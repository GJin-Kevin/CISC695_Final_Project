Customized Auto-Trading Assistance [CATA] is an application with ability to retrieve various financial data, 
to customize various trading strategies, to perform back-testing, and to implement strategies for auto-trading. 
There is not any application that includes all these functionalities in one platform 
and platforms with ability to perform back-testing usually cost a lot of money for investors, which is not practical for retail investors. 
This makes CATA a good resource for retail investors to navigate stock markets.
